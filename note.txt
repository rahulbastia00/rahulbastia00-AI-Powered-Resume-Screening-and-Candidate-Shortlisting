i have attached my model here is my idea "I want to build an end-to-end AI-powered resume screening and candidate shortlisting system. The development process should include clear, structured steps with specific libraries, tools, and resources—no suggestions, only direct requirements.

The project should cover:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing – Extract text from PDFs and DOCX, clean and preprocess resume/job description data.


2. NLP-Based Resume Parsing – Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) and embeddings to extract and match skills.


3. Candidate Shortlisting Using ML – Implement ML models to rank resumes based on job relevance" and i have done until step 3 now i want to persorm these action so perform these for me "Step 6: Deployment (DevOps & Cloud)
